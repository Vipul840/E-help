      <p>The world of web development is as wide as the internet itself.Much of our social and vocational lives play out
        on the internet, which prompts new industries aimed at creating, managing, and debugging the websites and
        applications that we increasingly rely on.</p>

        <h3 class="faq-page">What is web Development?</h3>
        <div class="faq-ans">
          <p>Web development is a broad description of the tasks and technologies that go into creating a website.
            It can be as simple as making a static text-based website or as elaborate as developing an interactive
            dynamic
            website.
            You can break web development into two different categories: frontend (client-side) and backend
            (server-side).
            Frontend code executes on the user's computer. This can include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
            Backend code runs on the server — this commonly includes communicating with a database and often involves
            languages like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP.
            Web development does not necessarily include the design process — it focuses on code.
            A web designer builds wireframes to mockup their vision for a website and then shares that with a developer.
            The developer is responsible for writing the code that implements the design.</p>

        <h3 class="faq-page">What are the steps to become a Web Developer ?</h3>
        <div class="faq-ans">
          <p>Some web developers will obtain a degree or certification in the field. However, most jobs don't require a
            specific degree or level of education, just demonstrated knowledge of the field. So, it is more important
            that you know how to show off your skills. You could highlight your skills through relevant work experience
            or a portfolio of past projects. You might also share code you have developed using a platform like GitHub,
            or participate in solution-based forums like StackOverflow that reward you for helping others. HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript are the first three coding languages you'll need to learn to break into web development. You
            need these three essential elements to create a modern website and work as a frontend web developer. HTML
            (Hyper-Text Markup Language) specifies the content of the website and builds the backbone. CSS (Cascading
            Style Sheets) styles ...... <a href="https://blog.udemy.com/how-to-become-a-web-developer/">

        <h3 class="faq-page">How long does it take to become a Web Developer</h3>
        <div class="faq-ans">
          <p>The answer to this question will depend on you. The more time you spend developing your skills, the
            faster you can become a web developer. The good news is that web development generally uses light-weight
            code that is easier to learn than many other languages. If dedicated, you can learn the basics of web
            development in a couple of months. But good web developers never stop learning. A better question might
            be, "What can I do to become a better web developer faster?" The answer to this question is practice.
            Becoming familiar with coding helps tremendously, but there is also a less obvious benefit of practicing.
            The more you code, the more you will run into problems or find bugs in your code. A significant aspect of
            web development is solving problems and debugging code. The better you get at solving problems and
            tracking down bugs, the faster you will get at coding.
